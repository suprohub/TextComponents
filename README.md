# Text Components RS

This is a library for easy implementation and usage of Minecraft's Text Components, designed for Java edition but extensible to match Bedrock's Components.

### Usage

You can make your first text component like this:

```rs
let component = TextComponent::plain("Hello World!");
```

Decorate it like this:

```rs
let component = component.color(Color::Red).bold(true);
```

Adding interactivility like this:

```rs
let component = component.insertion("Hello");

let component = component.hover_event(
    HoverEvent::show_text("Hello World!")
);

let component = component.click_event(
    ClickEvent::open_url("https://github.com/Steel-Foundation/TextComponents")
);
```

Once the component is ready to be sent or displayed only rests building it:

```rs
component.build(resolutor, PrettyTextBuilder);
// Equivalent of doing:
component.to_pretty(resolutor);
```

If you want to use serde you will need to do this instead:

```rs
component.resolve(resolutor).serialize(serializer);
```

### Displaying TextComponents

TextComponent implements ToString for easy logging, as you can see, a component
needs to be resolved before building it into any format, by default it uses a static
reference to NoResolutor, but can be changed to a custom one with:\
(Resolutor must be static, or made inside the function call)

```rs
set_display_resolutor(&Resolutor);
```


A text component can be printed like a string like this:

```rs
println!("{}", component.to_string());
// With format (colorful):
println!("{}", component.log());
```

If you want the log display format different to be able to parse it later, it can be done through `set_display_builder`, 
which will need a function returning the built string, this is an example with the PrettyTextBuilder (the default one):

```rs
set_display_builder(|component, resolutor| component.build(resolutor, PrettyTextBuilder))
```

### Roadmap

### Test

To test the capabilities of the library you can execute:

```bash
cargo run --example main
```

With all the features:

```bash
cargo run --example main --features serde,nbt,custom
```
